        <p class="card-desc on-right">
          Me and a friend, Gautham Venkateshwaran, created a MERN app as a submission to a hackathon. Its goal was to essentially make environmental charity fun, and we managed to snatch third place! I mostly worked on the front-end, using HTML, CSS, and React. Check it out on <a href="https://devpost.com/software/the-trees">Devpost</a>!

        <p class="card-desc on-left">
          This was a mobile reminders application I made in Android Studio using Java for a school assignment (I went a bit overboard ðŸ˜‹). I'm quite proud of it and learned a lot about Java, Android, and UI/UX design while working on it. It's not on the app store yet, though: there's a few more stubborn bugs hiding in the code I need to squish...

        <p class="card-desc on-right">
          Currently, I'm working on an on-call basis with the <a href="https://www.calgarytaichi.com/">Calgary Taichi and Martial Arts College</a>. One of my responsibilities is to design posters, emails, and certificates for the over 400 students who attend the college. I also manage the student database and often have to sift through and print off student records. Lately, I've been using my programming experience in Python to streamline these processes, finding ways to increase efficiency by programmatically generating report cards and am experimenting with the python <em>pandas</em> library to manage data!

          Together with some of my friends in Katy, Texas, I'm working on a React app to help band students find musical tutors. Music is one of my passions, and this is one of the ways I'm connecting with it! Currently, my goal with this project is to learn more about React and build more familiarity with the framework...

        <p class="card-desc on-right">
          Out of the desire to practice more with front-end development, and wanting to streamline my online browsing experience, I decided to create a personal new tab page for myself. The premise is quite simple: wouldn't it be nice if, when you opened a new tab, for a single key-press to take you to useful websites? I'm currently in the process of converting it into a Google Chrome Extension and upgrading its functionality, but you can check out an older version at <a href="https://ericli3690.github.io/navigation/">https://ericli3690.github.io/navigation/</a>.

        <p class="card-desc on-left">
          For fun, I wanted to see if I could create a Python script to help others conduct polls and even programmatically generate questions. A little crude and simple, but I think it's kind of neat, and it helped me understand Python better. It's online on <a href="https://github.com/ericli3690/PollProject2">Github</a>.
