    <h1>Kingdoms of Hexonia: RULES</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Basics:</strong></li>
      <li>This game is optimized for play at 90% zoom on a computer in the Chrome browser</li>
      <li>The goal of this game is to conquer the world, destroying all other empires in your way</li>
      <li>Press play to begin</li>
      <li>Choose the amount of players; there is no AI</li>
      <li>Everyone will begin in a corner of the map, and you start with 50 troops in your home square</li>
      <li>The corruption begins in the middle of the map</li>
      <li>The corruption spreads 1/4 of a block every turn</li>
      <li>Play starts with player 1</li>
      <li>At the beginning of the game, everyone has three moves per turn</li>
      <li>There are territories on the battlefield; conquering all the spaces that make a territory up will give you an extra move per turn; losing even one zone making up that territory will cause you to lose the move benefit from that zone, including from the corruption</li>
      <li>There are 20 territories in total; there is a image of them</li>
      <li>The "CORE" territory gives two moves instead of one</li>
      <li><strong>On your turn, you may:</strong></li>
      <li><em>TRAIN ARMY: (1 move each)</em> For every move you commit to this action, you can add 10 troops to your army, either an existing one, or you can create a new army in one of your conuquered territories</li>
      <li><em>MOVE: (1 move each)</em> You may move your army to an adjacent zone that is your own</li>
      <li><em>COLONIZE: (1 move each)</em> Take over a zone that does not house an army or is fortified</li>
      <li><em>ENGAGE: (2 moves each)</em> Do battle with another team on one of their zones; Do subtraction to figure out who wins, and the bigger army wins and gets to stay</li>
      <li>E.X. Blue team with 10 troops defending a zone VS Green team with 20 troops attacking: Green takes the square, the blue army is removed from the board, and green has 10 troops left in the square blue used to be defending</li>
      <li>If the armies are equal in strength, the armies are both wiped out and the defender keeps the zone</li>
      <li>Engaging destroys temples</li>
      <li><em>FORTIFY: (1 move each)</em> Adds 1 defense to a zone that one of your armies is in; defense points mean that an attacker needs an extra 15 troops to capture the now-fortified zone</li>
      <li>Zones can be fortified up to 4 times, and cannot be fortified twice in the same turn; if an enemy attacks a fortified zone, then the fortification remains, allowing the enemy to also exploit it</li>
      <li><em>CLEANSE: (2 moves each, cannot be used until a full territory has been conquered)</em> Eradicates the corruption from a zone that one of your armies is in, and prevents the corruption from ever spreading there again</li>
      <li><em>WORSHIP: (uses full turn)</em> Creates a temple in a zone that one of your armies is in that allows you to get an extra move per turn; the extra turn only lasts as long as that territory remains as yours; an enemy attack will destroy the temple</li>
      <li><em>TRUCE: (uses full turn)</em> For the next two rounds of turns, no one is allowed to use "ENGAGE"; This move cannot be used twice in a row, by yourself or by an enemy</li>
      <li>IMPORTANT: YOU MAY NOT "TRAIN ARMY" AND "ENGAGE" THE SAME ARMY IN THE SAME TURN</li>
      <li><strong>The Corruption:</strong></li>
      <li>The corruption is a sickness that targets the land, and spreads 1/4 of a zone every turn, and will target any zones adjacent to a current fully corrupted zone</li>
      <li>Fortifications slow down the corruption, and it takes 5 times to spread to a 1x fortified zone instead of 4, 6 times to spread to a 2x fortified zone, and etc.</li>
      <li>Additionally, every two rounds of turns, the corruption will randomly fortify an already corrupted square, causing you to have to "CLEANSE" that particular zone once plus the amount of times it has been fortified (by the corruption)</li>
      <li>The corruption can fortify a zone as much as it wants</li>
      <li>A fully corrupted zone will disrupt a fully collected territory</li>
    </ul>
